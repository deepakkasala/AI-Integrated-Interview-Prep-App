PROMPT:

I want to build a react application in which the backend for that application was already built using python-flask
That website deals with the resolving end user tickets raised by that organisation’s customers.
And provide solutions to resolve the queries in the tickets,

Our Ui is visible to the agent who solves the customer’s tickets.
Such that we need to build two web pages:

1. List of Tickets page
2. Ticket Details page

Header is common for both List of Tickets page and Ticket details page. Header should be on the top of the page.
Header contains one logo in the left and two logos in the right and a sample heading at the center.

LIST OF TICKETS PAGE:

1. It should display the list of tickets in this page in a table.
2. Heading part of the table should have these headings, Ticket ID, Issue, Details, Received on, status, action.
3. “Ticket ID” - should be alphanumeric.
4. “Issue” - it is like it describes about the incident in a single line (subject of the issue).
5. “Details” - it is a detailed description about the issue given by the customer.
6. “Received on” - Date and time of the ticket received. It should be in the format of [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
7. “Status” - It should have three options — 1. Waiting For User Service, 2.In Work, 3. Work In Progress(P), 4. Waiting For Reporter, 5.Resolved.
8. “Action” - Its a button having the text ‘Proceess’ that is common for every ticket.
9. When Agent Clicks on Process Button The app should be redirected to corresponding Ticket Details page. And should display the details as follows.

TICKET DETAILS PAGE:

The Ticket details is divided into four sections

1. Navbar
2. Resolution Steps
3. CheckList
4. Relevant Resources

Section 1. NAVBAR:

It should be the top of the page and display about the ticket that has

1. ticket ID (under that ID of the ticket),
2. Issue (under that Issue of the Incident and it should not exceed more than three words if it exceeds the limit it should have “…more” on clicking more it should display the complete text about the issue in a dialog box).
3. Details (under that Details of the Incident and it should not exceed more than three words if it exceeds the limit it should have “…more” on clicking more it should display the complete text about the Details in a dialog box)
4. Status(under tha,t status of the ticket).
5. Type (under that, it should display 1.incident, or 2.service request,).
6. Product (under that, Name of the product).
7. Assignee (under that, Name of the Assignee)

Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, these three should display on the page such that, it should take 1/3rd of entire page width for each section.

Section 2. RESOLUTION STEPS:
Its a text area box having some points of single lined statements describes steps to resolve the incident.

Section 3. CHECK LIST:
It should display the steps of RESOLUTION STEPS here and Under each step It should have a checkbox and a text “Open Task”, for each step.
Once the agent clicks on the checkbox it should display a tick and text should be changed to “Task Completed” , it means, the corresponding step that is ticked by the agent is completed.

Section 4. RELAVANT RESOURCES:
It’s a box having an input box and besides that it should have a Button with text “FIND”.

Once Agent types something about the incident and clicks FIND.
The Corresponding solutions for the query he typed should be displayed under the input box.

For the data you can use dummy json data stored in db.json and accessed through api created using json-server

There are some changes need to be done in both Components: List of Tickets and Ticket Details page.
Where In List of Tickets component we fetch the data from an api - “http://11.35.140.188:5000” using axis.get and and render that in the List of tickets table.

And When user clicks on process button of any listed tickets, then user will be redirected to Ticket Details page of Corresponding Ticket to resolve the Issue of the Ticket.

Here My requirements are changed again, as our backend team informed that We can fetch the corresponding Ticket Details using the same api with the route “http://11.35.140.188:5000/process/ticketId”. From this particular Api We can fetch the corresponding user clicked ticket details from backend,
Hence there is no need of using context Api to store the user clicked ticket details to use it over the app.

So Make required changes to the code in List of ticket and Ticket Details, such that, Retrieve the Ticket Id using useParams hook in TicketDetails page

And place the retrieved ticket from useParams in the api url route “http://11.35.140.188:5000/process/(replace ticketId retrieved from through useParams)” and get the Ticket Details from backend and pass it to navbar in order to render the ticket details in Nav bar. So make necessary changes to the code in List of tickets, Ticket details and Navbar components according to the requirements mentioned

We need to develop ProductOnboarding Page.

I need these things in the page:

1. First thing, A searchbar (When user types something Its should display suggestions like google search engine. The suggestion container should be displayed only when the user clicks on the searchbar to search something And when user finds the thing, he clicks on it and after selecting the keyword, it should be added to the search bar and the suggestion bar should be disappeared automatically after selection completed
2. Second Thing, Two Checkboxes one beside the other with labels(Incident and Service).
3. Third thing, I need a search bar with a “+” button beside search input bar, when user clicks on + button It should create a new search input bar under the current input bar. It should be scalable according to the user, when user clicks on + button as he can create how many inputs he want. also beside every input bar I need a close button “x”. If user doesn’t want the input bar he can delete by clicking the “x” button. By default I need one search bar and + button on the display.
4. Here I want the same functionality to be implemented twice similar to previous thing, Here I need two lists of scalable input bars that should be displayed one beside the other. First list of inputs belongs to Incident category and second list of inputs belongs to Service category.
5. Where selects both the checkboxes, then Both the Lists should be enable for the user, Or If user selected Incident checkbox then Incident list of inputs are only accessible or allowable to add inputs the service List should be disabled. Or If user selected service checkbox then Service list of inputs are only accessible or allowable to add inputs and incident List should be disabled.
6. Then I need one text input where it accepts URL link from user and It need to be validated on some conditions, If conditions are satisfactory then The link should be acceptable otherwise not.
7. Then I need Two inputs one beside the other first input is text input with placeholder “User ID” where user inputs userId and second one is drop down input where it displays list of roles and user chooses one role.
8. A button of type submit with text onboard Product.
9. And I need this entire data to be converted into an object and store it.

Apply beautiful css to the page where I need every input to be aligned in nicely manner
